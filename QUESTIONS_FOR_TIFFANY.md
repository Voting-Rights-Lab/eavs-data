Hey Tiffany! Got the 2024 EAVS data loaded successfully, but there are some methodology changes that need your input before I update the dashboards.

**Quick questions:**

**1. Registration section** - 2024 is missing voter removal data (people removed for moving, death, etc.) and confirmation notice data that existed in 2016-2022. Is this a methodology change? Should these just show as NULL for 2024?

**2. Mail section** - Big change here. 2024 doesn't have the detailed rejection reasons we tracked before (signature issues, late ballots, etc.). Instead it has new stuff like drop box data and ballot curing. Should I:
- Keep old rejection trends showing NULL for 2024, OR 
- Add the new drop box/curing fields to our views?

**3. UOCAVA section** - 2024 has transmission and return data but missing the counting/rejection data from previous years. Just map those to NULL for 2024?

The data is loaded and ready - just need to know how you want to handle these changes before updating the dashboards. Let me know what makes most sense for your analysis!
